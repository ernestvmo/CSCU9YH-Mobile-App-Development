# CSCU9YH-Mobile-App-Development

This project was realized as an assignment for the course CSCU9YH at the University of Stirling.<br>
The task was to create a convertion application that would allow the user to select two units, and then on a different fragment allow them to enter a value and convert it to the selected unit.<br><br>
All the required features were succesfully implemented and I even managed to implement a history tab that records all the transactions made and lets the user click on a previous transaction to bring it back into the conversion window (in case they would want to continue with that value).
